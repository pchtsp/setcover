setcover
========

A MIP implementation to solve the setcover problem using an open source python package to formulate the model and pass it to solvers. A commercial solver license is needed (CPLEX / GUROBI) in order to use them. Alternatively, CBC / GLPK can be used (they need to be installed as well).
